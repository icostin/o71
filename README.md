# [o71] Ostropel scripting engine

Tiny, portable, embeddable scripting engine.

The engine itself is freestanding (does not have any dependency, not even the standard C library). 
The scripting tool depends only on the standard C library.

The project is in early stages, it is not usable yet... Just take a [very] deep breath...
